    "text": "I am a Geography PhD student and research assistant at TransLAB (Transportation Research Lab) within the School of Earth, Environment & Society at McMaster University, working under the supervision of Dr. Darren Scott. My current research explores public transit and shared micromobility (e.g., bike share and shared electric scooters) across North America, with a special focus on Hamilton, Ontario. I apply data-driven and quantitative approaches to uncover patterns and improve transportation systems.\nPreviously, I earned an Honours Bachelor of Arts (HBA) Degree from the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC) in 2024, majoring in Economics for Management Studies, with minors in Geographic Information Science (GIS) and Applied Statistics, as well as a certificate in Computational Social Science. My works have twice been funded by the University of Toronto Excellence Award in 2023 and 2024. Additionally, I received the Governor General’s Silver Medal for achieving the highest academic standing among all HBA graduates at the University of Toronto in 2024. I have also been awarded the 2025–26 Ontario Graduate Scholarship for excellent academic performance, jointly funded by the Government of Ontario and McMaster University.\nBefore joining McMaster University, I was a research assistant in the Suburban Mobilities Cluster in the Department of Human Geography at UTSC. From 2022 to 2024, I participated in several projects under the supervision of Dr. Steven Farber, Dr. Andre Cire, and Dr. Ignacio Tiznado-Aitken, conducting survey and network data analysis to explore transportation accessibility, equity, and justice in suburban areas, particularly in Scarborough, Ontario.\nMy interests in spatial analysis and econometrics have inspired me to delve into examining the spatial patterns of social issues, with a particular focus on using GIS and statistical tools to visualize and analyze these patterns. With my extensive experience in R and Python, along with proficiency in various GIS software such as ArcGIS Pro and QGIS, I am well-equipped to tackle complex spatial and social problems from a quantitative approach.\nMoreover, as a passionate transit enthusiast, I find myself constantly drawn to the topic of public transit and transportation. I enjoy riding buses and trains, and this interest has motivated me to explore ways of enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of public transit. I am eager to utilize my interdisciplinary background to further investigate public transit and transportation issues through data-driven methods, with the aim of finding solutions to improve their functionality and identify service gaps to better serve the vulnerable population in society.",

    "text": "Workflow\n\nGenerate 3D building models on the UF campus\n\nIn the ArcGIS CityEngine, first, create a new project with a new scene. Then click file &gt; get map data, selecting the UF campus area. After that, align the downloaded 3D building models to the terrains. Finally, export the 3D building models into Esri Scene Layer Package (.slpk).\n\nDownload the JSON file from RTS API and convert it into Geojson\n\nDue to the API limitations, there is no command to return all the vehicles’ locations. To get around this, we need to create a python script to automate the multiple downloads and merge them into one file. In the “download_request_example.py”, I called the API four times to return different routes’ bus locations which together merged into one JSON that contains all the vehicle locations. Please note that each time I called the API, I filtered the JSON response from the API. Only after the proper filter, the JSON file’s structure is recognizable and convertible by the converter python script. Also, I created four artificial vehicle locations at the end of the JSON file which contains all four different occupancy levels of the buses, by doing this the legend in the later web app would always contain the four occupancy levels.\nThen we use the cmd to call the converter python script. Firstly, we set the directory to where the converter is located. Then we use the following code:\ncall \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\Scripts\\propy\" Json2GeoJSON.py &lt;json file location&gt;\nAfter the first run, the converter python script would create an ini file alongside the JSON file you use as the input. The first conversion would likely be unsuccessful as the configuration in the ini file is just created and not manually corrected based on the input data. After the first conversion, correct the ini file to exactly the same as the gainData.ini.\n\nUpload the models and layers to ArcGIS Online\n\nGet all the background layers like City of Gainesville roads, transit routes and stops from the city website’s open data portal. Upload all the background layers as well as the slpk file in step 1 and the Geojson file in step 2 to the ArcGIS online. Note: create a hosted feature layer for the Geojson file during the upload, as we will later constantly update it to make a real-time map.\n\nCreate a web scene and further use it to create a web app\n\nIn ArcGIS Online, use the feature layers that have been uploaded to firstly create a web scene. Then create a web app using the web scene. Remember in the web scene setting to set the refresh time to the minimum, which will reduce the update interval in the ArcGIS server later.\n\nConfig constant upload bat file in a local computer\n\nBefore updating the hosted feature layer that contains the vehicle information, we need to first store the ArcGIS authentication locally. Due to the UF Gatorlink using two-factor authentication to log in, it would be troublesome to simply store the username and password on the computer. The way to get around this is to first use the following python command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment:\ngis = arcgis.GIS(url=&lt;organization_arcgis_portal&gt;, username='', password='', profile='learn_user')\nThis command would store your username and password in the learn_user profile, however, so far it cannot go through the ArcGIS Online portal yet. After this then, before updating the feature layer, call the following command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment while keeping ArcGIS Pro running in the background:\ngis = arcgis.GIS(\"pro\", profile='learn_user')\nThis command would use ArcGIS Pro to authenticate the profile called learn_user. Please note that use the same account you use in ArcGIS Online in ArcGIS Pro.\nThen we can update the hosted feature layer that contains all the vehicle locations by the following command in the ArcGIS Pro python environment:\ncall \"%PROGRAMFILES%\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\Scripts\\propy\" OverwriteFS.py learn_user &lt;ID&gt; &lt;Name&gt; &lt;location of your downloaded json file&gt;\nNote the ID and the name correspond to the upper right corner and the lower-left corner respectively.\n\nFinally, we can use the windows task scheduler to run the bat file every minute to automatically update the hosted feature layer. Or we can use the Invisible_mode_exxec.vbs to hiddenly execute the bat file. Please note that if you want to schedule a task to run the vbs, you need to use the following setting:\nAction: Start a program\nProgram/script: C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\nAdd arguments (optional): C:\\Scripts\\script.vbs"

This study examines bike share trip data and subway delay records in Toronto to determine whether bike share mitigates service disruptions and enhances transit system resilience.\nAs part of the 2025 ECCE App Challenge, we analyzed the relationship between subway delays and bike share ridership. Our findings indicate a surge in bike share usage following subway service disruptions. However, alarmingly, increased bike share ridership is also associated with a rise in traffic collisions.\n\nData sources\nBelow are the data sources used in the data analysis component of the app challenge.

Subsequently, a hexagonal grid is generated with cells having a distance of 500 meters between opposing edges. Temporal dimensions are incorporated at 3-hour intervals, forming space-time hexagonal cubes.\nFor each space-time hexagon cube, the following metrics are calculated:\n\nTotal number of bike share trip starts.\nSubway delay minutes.\nNumber of traffic collisions.\n\nTwo-way fixed-effect linear regression model and linear probability model are applied as follows:\n\nTo model bike share trip starts and subway delay minutes: \\[\\log(\\text{bikeshare}_{it} + 1) = \\sum \\alpha_i + \\sum \\gamma_t + \\beta_1 \\text{subway delay}_{it} + \\epsilon_{it}\\]\nTo model the presence of traffic collisions and bike share trip starts: \\[I(\\text{collision}_{it} \\geq 1) = \\sum \\alpha_i + \\sum \\gamma_t + \\beta_1 \\text{bikeshare}_{it} + \\epsilon_{it}\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\alpha_i\\) represents the hexagon-specific fixed effect, \\(\\gamma_t\\) represents the time-interval-specific fixed effect, and OLS estimation procedures are employed for both models.\n\n\nDescriptive statistics\nThe Shiny app below visualizes bike share ridership, subway delays, and traffic collisions.

The predicted bike share ridership increased significantly under this simulated disruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\nBoth Subway Delay minutes and Bike Share trip starts are significant at the commonly-used 5% significance level.\nAn increase in subway delays (holding all else constant) correlates with an increase in bike share trip starts. Similarly, an increase in bike share trip starts (holding all else constant) corresponds to a higher probability of traffic collisions.\nTwo-way fixed effects control for variables that remain constant across either space or time, including temporal trends (e.g., weekends) and built environment factors (e.g., land use characteristics).\n\n\n\nModel evaluation\n\nThe model predicting \\(\\log(\\text{bikeshare}_{it} + 1)\\) achieves an \\(R^2\\) close to 0.8, indicating strong explanatory power.\nThe linear probability model predicting collisions has an \\(R^2\\) of approximately 0.03. Traffic collisions are rare and inherently random, meaning that the deterministic component of the process is theoretically small relative to the random component. Therefore, although the model does not explain much of the total variation, it remains informative, demonstrating a positive correlation between bike share ridership and traffic collisions."

    "text": "NoteAbstract:\n\n\n\nGrocery stores play a crucial role, especially for urban residents, as they provide essential daily food supplies. The locations of grocery stores are not randomly chosen but are the result of detailed decision-making processes by grocery companies. Understanding the locations these grocers choose to establish themselves is important for public health and urban planning, as geographic access to grocery stores impacts personal health. In this paper, I utilize open data to examine grocery store locations in Hamilton, Ontario, as a case study. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression model with spatial lagged terms is fitted and estimated using maximum likelihood methods. I identified noticeable spatial patterns in grocery store locations. Grocery stores tend to cluster in nearby dissemination areas, but when there are too many grocery stores, they tend to disperse. The number of grocery stores is also significantly associated with population density, dissemination area size, the percentage of residents who do not speak an official language at home, those living in single detached houses, and the distance to Hamilton downtown.\n\n\nThis project addresses the following research question:\n\nWhat areas in Hamilton have more or fewer grocery stores compared to other areas?\n\nYou can find the code used in this project by clicking here, and the data used in this project packaged into an R package here.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "NoteAbstract:\n\n\n\nOver the last two to three decades, urban centers globally have shown a growing commitment to enhancing active transportation infrastructure, including the establishment of dedicated bike lanes, bike-sharing initiatives, and comprehensive active mobility networks (City of Toronto, n.d.). Toronto’s endorsed docked bike-sharing program, Bike Share Toronto, has been supported by Tangerine Bank since 2011 (Bike Share Toronto, n.d.; El-Assi et al., 2017). While bike-sharing systems inherit the general advantages of cycling, they also offer unique benefits like increased convenience and potential cost savings (Fishman, 2016). Nonetheless, these systems encounter specific challenges that can impede their accessibility and equitable use among diverse demographic groups, primarily due to the fixed docking stations and associated first and last-mile connectivity issues. This study scrutinizes the Bike Share Toronto system through the lens of equity. Employing catchment area analysis, we discovered disparities in service provision: an oversupply to White, Chinese, and low-income populations contrasted with an undersupply to Black and female demographics. These findings indicate significant opportunities for enhancing the system’s equitable distribution of services. Additionally, we performed a suitability analysis to pinpoint priority zones for potential network expansion, aiming to bolster equitable access across the city.\n\n\nThis project addresses the following two research questions:\n\nHow equitable is the access to Bike Share Toronto for all Toronto residents, especially for population subgroups based on gender, income or ethnicity?\nWhich Bike Share Toronto service areas have higher or lower levels of equity, and where should the system expansion be prioritized to improve the service provision equity?\n\nYou can find the code used in this project by clicking here and the online dashboard through this link.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here.\n\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

    "text": "# load packages used in this post\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Hmisc)\nlibrary(latex2exp)\n\nTime-series regression is a common method to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables over time. However, this method can be biased if the dependent variable follows an autoregressive process, which means that its current value depends on its past values. In this blog post, I will explore the nature and magnitude of this bias, following the work of Alex and Kendall (1954).\nThe first step is to generate data from an AR(1) process. An AR(1) process is defined by the following equation:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n  y_t=&\\rho y_{t-1}+u_t\\\\\n  where\\ &u_t\\sim N(0,1)\\\\\n  &y_0\\sim N(0,1)\n\\end{array}\n\\] Due to the endogeneity issues, the OLS estimate for the following regression would produce biased estimate for \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\).\n\\[\ny_t=\\hat{\\beta}_0+\\hat{\\rho}y_{t-1}+\\epsilon_t\n\\]\nTo generate data from this process and carry out estimation, I use the following R code:\n\nar1_bias &lt;- function(n, rho, times) {\n  return_df &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = times, ncol = length(rho)))\n  colnames(return_df) &lt;- gsub(\"-\", \"_\", paste0(\"rho\", rho))\n  \n  for (count in 1:times) {\n    # create a dataframe to hold samples\n    df &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = n, ncol = length(rho)))\n    colnames(df) &lt;- gsub(\"-\", \"_\", paste0(\"rho\", rho))\n    \n    for (i in 1:length(rho)) {\n      df[1, i] &lt;- rnorm(1)\n      for(j in 2:n) {\n        df[j, i] &lt;- rho[i]*df[j-1, i] + rnorm(1)\n      }\n    }\n    \n    for (i in colnames(df)) {\n      df[, paste0(i, \"_1\")] &lt;- Lag(df[,i])\n    }\n    \n    ols_estimate &lt;- data.frame(rho = rho, rho_hat = NA)\n    j &lt;- 1\n    \n    for (i in gsub(\"-\", \"_\", paste0(\"rho\", rho))) {\n      str_exp &lt;- paste0(i, \"~\", i, \"_1\")\n      exp_for &lt;- as.formula(str_exp)\n      holder &lt;- lm(exp_for, data = df)\n      ols_estimate[j,2] &lt;- holder$coefficients[[2]]\n      j &lt;- j + 1\n    }\n    \n    ols_estimate$diff &lt;- ols_estimate$rho_hat - ols_estimate$rho\n    return_df[count,] &lt;- ols_estimate$diff\n  }\n  \n  return(return_df)\n}\n\nThe bias in the OLS estimation is calculated as\n\\[\n\\hat{Bias}=E(\\hat{\\rho}-\\rho)=E(\\hat{\\rho})-\\rho\n\\]\nHere we carry out simulations for different values of \\(\\rho\\) and sample size \\(n\\).\n\n# for reproductivity\nset.seed(123)\n\nsim &lt;- ar1_bias(n = 51, \n                rho = seq(-0.5, 1.5, 0.1), \n                times = 3000)\n\nsim |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"rho\", values_to = \"diff\") |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = gsub(\"_\", \"-\", rho)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = parse_number(rho)) |&gt;\n  group_by(rho) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(diff)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = mean)) + \n  geom_point() + geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"$\\\\rho$\"), y = \"Bias\",\n       title = \"n=51\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsim &lt;- ar1_bias(n = 101, \n                rho = seq(-0.5, 1.5, 0.1), \n                times = 3000)\n\nsim |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"rho\", values_to = \"diff\") |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = gsub(\"_\", \"-\", rho)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = parse_number(rho)) |&gt;\n  group_by(rho) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(diff)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = mean)) + \n  geom_point() + geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"$\\\\rho$\"), y = \"Bias\",\n       title = \"n=101\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsim &lt;- ar1_bias(n = 301, \n                rho = seq(-0.5, 1.5, 0.1), \n                times = 3000)\n\nsim |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"rho\", values_to = \"diff\") |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = gsub(\"_\", \"-\", rho)) |&gt;\n  mutate(rho = parse_number(rho)) |&gt;\n  group_by(rho) |&gt;\n  summarise(mean = mean(diff)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = rho, y = mean)) + \n  geom_point() + geom_line() +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"#1f78b4\") +\n  labs(x = TeX(\"$\\\\rho$\"), y = \"Bias\",\n       title = \"n=301\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we can see the bias increases as the population parameter \\(\\rho\\) approaches 1 and the bias persists even when \\(\\rho=0\\).

It examined the Bike Share Toronto system and used the R5 routing engine to address the following two research questions.\n\nRQ1. What are the travel speeds of cyclists in the Bikeshare Toronto System?\nRQ2. To what extent do the existing bike lanes complement the Bikeshare Toronto System?\n\nTo answer these two research questions, I simulated the shortest cycling paths between every pair of Toronto bike-share stations using the OpenStreetMap road network and the R5 routing engine. I estimated the average cycling speed within the system by calculating the seasonal average cycling speeds at each station. I also created the estimated travel flow by aggregating the simulated paths and visually comparing them with the existing bike lanes in Toronto. The project results showed that the average travelling speed in the bike-share system was at least 12 km/h and that the existing bike lanes did not complement the bike-share system well.\nYou can find codes used in this project by clicking here.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

    "text": "I created an R package called sifr that allows users to perform basic spatial interpolation of sociodemographic and built-environment variables. These variables are useful for studying the characteristics and patterns of urban spaces, especially subway stations. The package contains functions that can take point data, such as the coordinates of subway stations, and interpolate the values of variables based on the surrounding areas such as calculating population density fall inside the subway station geometry buffers. These interpolated variables can then be used as inputs for cluster analysis or econometric analysis to explore the relationships between subway stations and their context such as built environments. The package is mainly designed for point data, but it may also work with other types of spatial data (which have not been thoroughly tested). You can find the source code of the package here.

    "text": "NoteAbstract:\n\n\n\nBike thefts pose a significant deterrent to urban cycling. This research delves into the influence of police presence on bike thefts and the geographical scope of its deterrent effect. Leveraging bike theft records from 2014 to 2023 in Toronto, alongside the most recent Canadian census data, I employ two-way fixed-effect Zero-inflated Negative Binomial Regression models to scrutinize the impact of network walking distance to the nearest police facility on the number of bike thefts within each census tract. To ensure robustness, I present a variety of model specifications, including OLS multiple regressions, Poisson regressions, and standard Negative Binomial Regression. The findings indicate that a police facility within a 500-metre radius notably curtails bike thefts, with statistical significance at the 0.05 level. Yet, this deterrent effect wanes with increasing distance and becomes inconsequential beyond 500 metres. Furthermore, at distances exceeding 2 kilometres, the presence of police facilities does not influence the number of bike thefts. The study infers that police facilities exert a localized effect on bike theft prevention in urban areas. Consequently, merely increasing the number of police facilities city-wide is not an efficacious strategy for reducing bike theft. Policymakers are thus encouraged to consider alternative methods or strategies for enhancing crime deterrence.\n\n\nThis project addresses the following two research questions:\n\nWhat causal influence does the presence of police facilities have on the frequency of bike thefts in Toronto?\nUpon observing a deterrent effect, to what extent does the proximity of police facilities causally mitigate bike theft incidents in Toronto?\n\nYou can find the code used in this project by clicking here.\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here."

Decoding the first-and-last mile: Analyzing the transit connecting bike share GPS routes in Hamilton, Ontario with spatiotemporal distance decay. Travel Behaviour and Society, 42, 101122. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2025.101122\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThe well-known first-and-last mile (FM/LM) problem has long plagued traditional fixed-route public transit systems. Recently, emerging shared micromobility services, such as bike share, have been gaining popularity and quickly developing worldwide. These services present the potential to complement public transit by serving as an FM/LM solution. This study leverages Hamilton Bike Share Global Positioning System routes data and employs a novel spatiotemporal distance decay with built environment adjustment method to quantify whether bike share trips are FM/LM trips on a continuous scale ranging from 0 to 1. This approach provides a more detailed usage pattern at the road level and a more realistic identification of FM/LM trips compared to the commonly used buffer zone approach applied to origin and destination pair trip data. Subsequently, we examine the spatiotemporal patterns and trip attributes of FM/LM trips and how they differ from all bike share trips. The findings reveal distinct differences in temporal, spatial, and trip attributes between FM/LM and all bike share trips. We found that bike share trips are frequently used by riders to cover the distance between transit stops and their workplaces. Additionally, FM trips are generally more challenging compared to LM trips due to a significantly higher number of left and U-turns. Policy recommendations are proposed to enhance wayfinding, expand cycling infrastructure, and promote integrated bike share and transit usage. This research highlights the potential of bike share systems to address the FM/LM problem and provides empirical evidence to inform future urban transportation planning and policy development. It also offers a methodological framework for identifying FM/LM trips using individual trip data such as origin and destination pairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipPoster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYin, Z., Jamal, S., Tiznado-Aitken, I., & Farber, S.

Applied Geography, 183, 103738. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2025.103738\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nNeighbourhood satisfaction is a key topic in urban planning due to its impact on well-being and inequality among urban dwellers. While determinants of neighbourhood satisfaction have been studied extensively, less is known about individual characteristics such as travel behaviour, political values, transport barriers, and aspirations, beyond traditional sociodemographics. Additionally, spatial modelling of neighbourhood satisfaction remains underexplored. This study utilizes the Scarborough Survey, a multidimensional dataset from Scarborough, Ontario, to investigate how travel behaviour, political values, transport barriers, and aspirations influence neighbourhood satisfaction. A spatial ordinal probit model was used, accounting for sociodemographics, subjective neighbourhood characteristics, and objective neighbourhood characteristics. Findings reveal significant impacts of these individual characteristics on neighbourhood satisfaction, with sociodemographics’ effects mediated through these variables. Interestingly, no positive spatial autocorrelation was found for neighbourhood satisfaction after controlling for other factors, suggesting limited social bonds or interactions among neighbours in suburban areas. The results highlight opportunities for community events or local organizations to rebuild these connections and enhance satisfaction in suburban neighbourhoods. This work provides new insights into neighbourhood satisfaction and offers pathways for improving the living conditions of vulnerable suburban communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiznado-Aitken, I., Yin, Z., & Farber, S.

Using a survey of 1,850 residents in Scarborough, an eastern suburb of Toronto, we used descriptive statistics and an exploded logit model to identify which environmental factors, sociodemographic characteristics, travel behaviors, political values, mobility options and transport barriers, and aspirations influence residents’ transport priorities in terms of space and investment.  Overall, transit investments are considered the top priority, followed by walking, driving, and cycling, with clear neighbourhood-specific variations. Newcomers, older adults, and racialized groups prefer sustainable transport options, while women, white and right-wing individuals prioritize car investment. Moreover, transport priorities are closely linked to people’s lifestyles and neighborhood aspirations, as reflected in the destinations they want near their homes. These findings enhance our understanding of transportation preferences and offer valuable insights for developing effective, context-specific sustainable transportation strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMwesigwa, L., Yin, Z., & Farber, S. (2024). Evaluating the level of access and equity of the bus rapid transit (BRT) system: The case of Dar-Es-Salaam, Tanzania. Journal of Transport Geography, 119, 103953. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2024.103953\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nBus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems have witnessed significant growth worldwide, particularly in rapidly urbanizing cities in the developing world, often implemented through public-private partnerships to foster economic growth. However, the success of such ambitions relies on ensuring equitable transit access for all residents, including those living with poverty or other social disadvantages. The purpose of this study is to explore transit access, coverage, and equity of the BRT system in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania using infrastructure-based measures of proximity to transit stations and stops. In particular, the equitable distribution of transit access patterns is explored in relation to neighborhood socio-economic strata in the catchment areas within a 30-min walking distance. The study’s findings reveal notable disparities in the level of access among various socio-economic strata, with the least deprived population benefiting the most from the Dar-es-Salaam BRT system. As more BRT phases are implemented, there is a continuous increase in the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) within the areas not covered by the BRT system. This suggests that access improvements predominantly favor the wealthier population rather than effectively addressing the needs of the impoverished population. To enhance access and achieve more equitable outcomes, it is crucial to implement targeted strategies and measures. These may include improved integration of the BRT with a feeder system, continuous improvement of Non-Motorized Transport (NMT) facilities, and the promotion of equitable transit-oriented development along the BRT corridor. These initiatives play a vital role in ensuring that vulnerable populations, especially the poor, have access to and can benefit from the BRT services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYin, Z., Rybarczyk, G., Zheng, A., Su, L., Sun, B., & Yan, X. (2024). Shared micromobility as a first- and last-mile transit solution? Spatiotemporal insights from a novel dataset. Journal of Transport Geography, 114, 103778. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2023.103778\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first- and last-mile (FM/LM) problem is a major deterrent to public transit use. With the rise of shared micromobility options such as shared e-scooters in recent years, there is a growing interest in understanding their potential to serve as a last-mile transit solution. However, empirical data regarding the integrated use of shared micromobility and public transit have been limited so far. As a result, much is unknown regarding the spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of shared micromobility trips serving as an FM/LM connection to transit. This paper addresses these knowledge gaps by leveraging a novel dataset (i.e., the Spin post-ride survey dataset) that records thousands of transit-connecting shared e-scooter trips in Washington DC. Specifically, we used the dataset to reveal the spatiotemporal patterns of transit-connecting shared e-scooter trips in Washington DC, resulting in some major policy insights regarding the integral use of shared e-scooters and public transit. We further leveraged the dataset to validate if and to what extent a commonly applied buffer-zone approach can infer FM/LM micromobility trips accurately. Statistical tests showed that the actual FM/LM Spin e-scooter trips differ from inferred FM/LM Spin e-scooter trips in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This indicates that the common practice of inferring FM/LM micromobility trips with a buffer-zone approach can lead to inaccurate estimates of transit-connecting micromobility trips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipPoster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the embedded PDF is not displayed properly, please click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang, E., Yin, Z., Broaddus, A., & Yan, X. (2024). Shared e-scooters as a last-mile transit solution? Travel behavior insights from Los Angeles and Washington D.C. Travel Behaviour and Society, 34, 100663. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tbs.2023.100663\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAbstract\n\n\n\n\n\nShared e-scooters are quickly emerging in the U.S., presenting potential to enhance public transit by serving as a last-mile feeder mode. However, much is unknown about user preferences and travel behavior regarding e-scooter and transit integration. This study addresses this knowledge gap by conducting a travel behavior survey in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, California, both early adopters of dockless micromobility. We find that the last-mile problem deters transit use for about 70% of respondents, among whom over 60% have considered e-scooters for last-mile transit connections. However, this intention frequently did not translate into actual use due to a variety of barriers. We further developed ordinal and binary logit models to examine factors shaping intention and actual use of shared e-scooters as a last-mile solution. Results suggest the outcomes of interest are positively associated with transit use frequency and safety rating of e-scooter riding. Somewhat surprisingly, household income is not a significant variable in all models. Women and older adults are less likely to consider using e-scooters as a last-mile feeder mode. People of color and individuals without a college degree who ride e-scooters have a greater percentage of their shared e-scooter trips made to connect with transit compared to White people and those with a college degree. These findings contribute to the understanding of equity in shared micromobility. Finally, to promote transit and micromobility integration, policymakers may introduce bundled fares, integrated payment, promote e-scooter safety, increase e-scooters availability at transit stops, and improve bike lane infrastructure connecting to transit.",

The 2021 Marshall Fire forced the evacuation of 30,000 people and destroyed over 1,000 structures within Boulder County, Colorado. We conducted a survey with households affected by the grass fire to analyze their evacuation decision-making and travel behavior. The survey was based on previous surveys that members of our team developed to investigate the public response to the 2016 Chimney Tops 2 Fire in Tennessee and the 2019 Kincade Fire in California, but we have included new measures of transportation mode, route, and destination choices made by evacuees. We used linear and logistic regression models to determine the factors that influenced resident risk perception and the decision to evacuate and compared results from our analysis to the previous studies. We found significant variability in the factors that influenced risk perception and evacuation decisions across the three fires. The report also presents descriptive statistics to summarize our findings on evacuee travel behavior during the Marshall Fire.",
